# Kinect_vs_MM
Bradley's code for comparing Kinect and Motion Monitor data

In 'My Code': 
  main_MM.py processes Motion Monitor data
  main_Kin.py processes Kinect data
  functions.py holds the main functions needed to read data, apply transformations etc.
  quat_functions.py holds things like quaternion multiplication etc.
  APDM.sto files are created from the APDM.csv files and can be viewed in OpenSim using 'Preview sensor data'
